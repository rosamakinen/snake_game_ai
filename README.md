# snake_game_ai
training a neural network with deep Q learning to play the snake game

In this project I explore reinforcement learning and Python by training a model to play the classic snake game.
You can run the code by executing ai_agent.py

The agent was able to reach a high score of 64 after 90 training games.

At the start of training the model, the agent acted very incoherently, running around in circles and often running straight into a wall as it did not have enough data to make educated choices.

At the best run the agent was able to reach the high score of 64, although it was not always making the most optimal choices. On many occasions it for example first turns away from the food and goes through a longer route.
